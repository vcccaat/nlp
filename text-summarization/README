This directory contains a pre-trained model similar to that described in the paper "Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks" https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04368.pdf.

Due to differences in the code used for the original experiment, and the publicly-released code (e.g. upgrading to Tensorflow 1.0, cleaning up the code), it is not possible to release the original model.

TRAINING DETAILS:

The model was trained by a similar method to that described in the paper, though we used the following, slightly different schedule for increasing max_enc_steps and max_dec_steps:

Start with max_enc_steps=10, max_dec_steps=10
At about 71k iterations, increase to max_enc_steps=50, max_dec_steps=50
At about 116k iterations, increase to max_enc_steps=100, max_dec_steps=50
At about 184k iterations, increase to max_enc_steps=200, max_dec_steps=50
At about 223k iterations, increase to max_enc_steps=400, max_dec_steps=100

These changes are reflected in the global_step/sec summaries in Tensorboard.
  Note: the increase in global_step/sec at around 195k is because we changed the "default_device" setting in the code, which was more efficient (this change is now committed to the github repository).

Note: the concurrent eval job was run with max_enc_steps=400 and max_dec_steps=100 throughout, which likely explains why the eval loss was less than the train loss for most of training time.


TO DO MORE TRAINING YOURSELF:

If you want to train the model some more (with coverage), run (from the pointer-generator directory)

python run_summarization.py --mode=train --data_path=/path/to/data/train_* --vocab_path=/path/to/data/vocab --log_root=/path/to/directory/containing/pretrained_model --exp_name=pretrained_model --max_enc_steps=400 --max_dec_steps=100 --coverage=1

Note: you can alter e.g. max_enc_steps and max_dec_steps and other hyperparameters if you wish


TO RUN (CONCURRENT) EVAL:

python run_summarization.py --mode=eval --data_path=/path/to/data/val_* --vocab_path=/path/to/data/vocab --log_root=/path/to/directory/containing/pretrained_model --exp_name=pretrained_model --max_enc_steps=400 --max_dec_steps=100 --coverage=1


TO RUN DECODE ON THE DATA:

The command that produced the decode_test_400maxenc_4beam_35mindec_120maxdec_ckpt directory (including ROUGE eval on entire test set) was:

python run_summarization.py --mode=decode --data_path=/Users/sze/Desktop/nlp/text-summarization/tokenized_news/test.bin  --vocab_path=/Users/sze/Desktop/nlp-dataset-algo/model/preprocessing/cnn-dailymail-preprocessing/finished_files/vocab  --log_root=/Users/sze/Desktop/nlp-dataset-algo/model/--exp_name=pretrained_model --max_enc_steps=400 --max_dec_steps=120 --coverage=1 --single_pass=1

If you'd like to see randomly-generated examples from the validation set print to screen, run:

python run_summarization.py --mode=decode --data_path=/path/to/data/val_* --vocab_path=/path/to/data/vocab --log_root=/path/to/directory/containing/pretrained_model --exp_name=pretrained_model --max_enc_steps=400 --max_dec_steps=120 --coverage=1

Note, this will also produce a constant stream of .json data files in the decode/ directory. These files can be visualized with the attention visualizer https://github.com/abisee/attn_vis which will allow you to see where the model is attending, and the values of the generation probabilities.
